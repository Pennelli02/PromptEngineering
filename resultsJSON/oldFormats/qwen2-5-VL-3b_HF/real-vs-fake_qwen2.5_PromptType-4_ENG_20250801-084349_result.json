[generated] | [a long explanation clearly stating the reasoning behind your choice]. [Uncertain] | [a long explanation clearly stating the reasoning behind your choice]. Your detailed explanation should: - Clearly describe the specific visual cues you observe (facial features, artifacts, lighting, or inconsistencies). - State what led you to your judgment. - Remain focused on the image analysis without mentioning external factors.\nRespond ONLY with the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"result\": \"[real]\" or \"[generated]\" or \"[uncertain]\",\n  \"explanation\": \"A precise explanation based on observed visual clues from the image.\"\n}\nDo NOT include generic phrases like 'there are no artifacts'. Be visual and detailed in your analysis.",
