First, there are slight asymmetries in the glasses: the right and left parts are not perfectly aligned, a common detail in synthetic faces. Second, the background appears blurred and lacks realistic depth, with no distinguishable elements, showing an unnatural blending of hair and head contours. Additionally, the lighting on the face is too uniform and lacks consistent shadows; for example, there are no shadows cast by the glasses, as would be expected in a real photo. The teeth are overly regular and symmetrical, and the eyes appear perfectly centered and devoid of complex reflections or imperfections, which are normally found in real human faces. All these subtle signals combined strongly indicate that this is an artificially generated face.\"\n    }\n    ",
