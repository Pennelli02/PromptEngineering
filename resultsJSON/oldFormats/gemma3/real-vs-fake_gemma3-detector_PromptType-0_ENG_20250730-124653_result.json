Always respond using this clear, structured format: [real face] | [a long explanation clearly stating the reasoning behind your choice]. [generated] | [a long explanation clearly stating the reasoning behind your choice]. [Uncertain] | [a long explanation clearly stating the reasoning behind your choice]. Your detailed explanation should: - Clearly describe the specific visual cues you observe (facial features, artifacts, lighting, or inconsistencies). - State what led you to your judgment. - Remain focused on the image analysis without mentioning external factors.\n"
