Wrinkles and Creases - Real human skin has pores, fine lines, and deeper wrinkles that are more pronounced with age. Generated images might lack these realistic textures or have less variation.\n\n4. Lighting Reflections - Real human faces often show light reflection patterns on the skin, which can be subtle but can give away digital alterations.\n\n5.
